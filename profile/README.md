# Saml2aws

In our case, when we login using saml2aws we only statyed logged in to the profile for an hour, this can be a PITA so these files are examples of the fucntions we added to our profiles, one for powershell and one for bash. You will need to adapt before adding to your bash or powershell profile.

If you set them up with your creds and roles when your logged out of aws your type:

```cli
loginaws
```

and you refresh your credentials.
